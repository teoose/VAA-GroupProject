# Motivation

The motivation of the project is to use open-source government data to provide free-to-use visualisation tools that is suitable for different groups of users:

1.  

2.  

3.  

# Objectives

The objective of the project is to:

1.  examine open-source government data on terrorist events worldwide and derive useful variables that affect the international terrorist incidents, and
2.  build a web-enabled interactive visual analytics application by using R Shiny based on World Terrorism Database.

# Challenge

# Data

The project will examine the Global Terrorism Databaseâ„¢ (GTD) from [University of Maryland](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd){target="_blank"}. The dataset consist of XX variables and XX datapoints. The team intends to manipulate the dataset as follows:

1.  Create new columns........ to achieve..
2.  Filter dataset... to achieve..

# Methodology & Analytical Approach

For this project, the following approach will be taken by the team:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing irrelevant variables, filtering variables and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis via Data Visualisation Methods:** Analyse the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and explore correlation between variables. Such as using:

    1.  Network graph

    2.  Time-series bubble plot

    3.  Geospatial heatmap/ hotspot

3.  **Confirmatory Data Analysis via Statistical Methods:** Analyse the dataset using statistical testing tools to test hypotheses, evaluate the findings and arguments (e.g. strength of relationships between variables) and make statistical observations under uncertainty.

    1.  Model Diagnostic: checking for multicollinearity

    2.  Model Diagnostic: checking normality assumption

    3.  Oneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method

    4.  Significant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()
