The dataset consist of XX variables and XX datapoints. The team intends to manipulate the dataset as follows:\n\nCreate new columns…….. to achieve..\nFilter dataset… to achieve..\n\n\n\nMethodology & Analytical Approach\nFor this project, the following approach will be taken by the team:\n\nData Preparation: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing irrelevant variables, filtering variables and encoding categorical variables if necessary.\nExploratory Data Analysis via Data Visualisation Methods: Analyse the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and explore correlation between variables. Such as using:\n\nNetwork graph\nTime-series bubble plot\nGeospatial heatmap/ hotspot\n\nConfirmatory Data Analysis via Statistical Methods: Analyse the dataset using statistical testing tools to test hypotheses, evaluate the findings and arguments (e.g. strength of relationships between variables) and make statistical observations under uncertainty.\n\nModel Diagnostic: checking for multicollinearity\nModel Diagnostic: checking normality assumption\nOneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method\nSignificant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()\n\n\n\n\nPrototype\n&lt;insert text&gt;\n\n\nR Shiny Packages\n&lt;insert text&gt;\n\n\nProject Schedule\n&lt;insert text&gt;\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
